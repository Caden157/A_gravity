First, with the sensor and the Arduino UNO, you will upload the code and make some cycles.
After take T1 and T2, run the py code, feed the fields with the data of experiment, then
it's done! You receive the local gravity accelerate in m/sÂ².

python code:
the exe python code is in "Tratar>dist>Tratar_g"
and the souce code is in "Tratar>build>Tratar_g"
